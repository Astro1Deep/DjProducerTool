# DJProducerTools Feature Highlights

- Safe-first workflow: `SAFE_MODE=1`, `DJ_SAFE_LOCK=1`, `DRYRUN_FORCE=0`, with confirmations and quarantine.
- Catalog, hash index, duplicate plan, backups of `_Serato_` and metadata, and TSV reports (ffprobe, playlists, relink helper).
- Video prep (ffprobe report + transcode plan) with ffmpeg dry-run and optional hardware codecs.
- OSC/API server, BPM/librosa insights, DMX/OSC timeline planning, and Playlist→OSC/DMX exports.
- Deep ML/TF Lab: local embeddings, tags, similarity, anomalies, segments, loudness, matching, video_tags (CLIP), music_tags (CLAP/MusicGen), master report, and downloadable ONNX/TFLite weights.
- Consolidation helpers (plan + batched rsync) with space checks, rsync compatibility, and shared corpus reuse.
